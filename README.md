# SentimentAnalysis
My contribution to Twitter Sentiment Analysis Challenge by @Sirajology on Youtube

To run this, you need to create a twitter app and get all the credentials needed
<b>Install tweepy</b>
<i>pip install tweepy</i>

<b>install textblob</b>
<i>pip install textblog</i>

When you're done, in your terminal run:

python sentiment analysis.py --keyword replacethiswithanysearchkeyword

The aim of this was to get tweets about a certain topic (ie: the keyword) and analyse it with TextBlob so find whether it's a negative or positive tweet and save it to a CSV file
