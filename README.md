# SentimentAnalysis
My contribution to Twitter Sentiment Analysis Challenge by @Sirajology on Youtube

To run this, you need to create a twitter app and get all the credentials needed
Install tweepy
pip install tweepy

install textblob
pip install textblog

When you're done, in your terminal run:

python sentiment analysis.py --keyword replacethiswithanysearchkeyword

The aim of this was to get tweets about a certain topic (ie: the keyword) and analyse it with TextBlob so find whether it's a negative or positive tweet and save it to a CSV file
